# AES Encryption and Decryption with Python

This repository provides a Python class `AES_en` for encrypting and decrypting data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. It supports various modes of operation such as CFB, CBC, ECB, and OFB.

## Features

- Encryption: Encrypt data using AES algorithm with different modes.
- Decryption: Decrypt encrypted data back to its original form.
- Support for Multiple Modes: Choose from different AES modes for encryption and decryption.
- Base64 and Hex Encoding: Encode encrypted data in Base64 or hexadecimal format.
- Padding: Supports PKCS5 padding method for ensuring block sizes compatibility.
